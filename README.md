# Spirit Island Toolbox

Welcome to Spirit Island Toolbox. This is a webapp created to replace the invader board for Spirit Island, to reduce the amount of setup needed when playing the board game. 

# Features

##### Turn Tracking
Turns are automatically tracked and advanced with a single button press. The indicator pane updates dynamically depending on what is coming next, including invader actions and adversary-specific actions. 

##### Fear Tracking
Amount of fear tokens earned and fear cards earned are dynamically displayed on the left pane, and resolved when the turn tracker reaches the fear card phase. 

##### Card Drawing
Fear cards and event cards are automatically drawn when the corresponding phases have been reached. 

##### Special Actions
Actions that influence the setup of the invader board (e.g. England 6, )
